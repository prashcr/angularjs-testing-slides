# AngularJS Testing

My first attempt at using an HTML5 presentation framework (bespoke.js).

It was a great experience, especially the fact that sharing the slides is as simple as sharing a URL.

However, it came across as fragile (layout breaks too easily), and restrictive (lack of control).
For future use, I'd definitely go for reveal.js

## View slides locally

First, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io): `$ npm install -g bower`
3. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com): `$ npm install -g gulp`

Then, install dependencies and run the preview server:

```bash
$ npm install && bower install
$ gulp serve
```
